Privacy Policy for Stick It Out

Effective date: 27/09/2025

We respect your privacy. This policy explains how Stick It Out handles your information.

Information We Collect

Stick It Out does not collect, store, or share personal data long-term.

At game startup, we temporarily ask for:

Your age

A simple identifier (ID)

This is used only to filter or adjust content so younger players are not exposed to inappropriate material.

This information is processed in real time and not stored beyond the current play session.

No registration or account is required.
No personal information (such as name, email, or phone number) is requested.
No analytics or tracking tools are used.
No advertisements are shown.

Information Collected by Meta

Please note that while Stick It Out itself does not collect or store personal information long-term, the Meta Quest platform may collect data such as device information, crash reports, or usage statistics. This collection is governed by Meta’s own Privacy Policy. We do not have access to or control over this information.

Data Deletion

Because Stick It Out does not store personal data beyond each game session, there is no information for us to delete.

If in the future the game adds features that require storing user information, you will be able to request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us at the email listed below. Any such requests will be processed promptly.

Children’s Privacy

Stick It Out is designed for players of all ages. To protect younger audiences, the game asks for age and ID at startup to adjust or restrict certain content. This information is not kept after the session ends.

In accordance with platform requirements, the game is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect or retain any personal information from children under 13.

Third Parties

Because Stick It Out does not connect to external services, no information is shared with third parties.

Changes to This Policy

If we ever make changes to this Privacy Policy (for example, if new features are added that require data), the updated policy will be posted here with a new effective date.
