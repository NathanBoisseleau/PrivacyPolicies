We respect your privacy. This policy explains how Stick It Out handles your information.

Information We Collect

Stick It Out does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users.

No registration or account is required.

No personal information (such as name, email, or phone number) is requested.

No analytics or tracking tools are used.

No advertisements are shown.

Information Collected by Meta

Please note that while Stick It Out itself does not collect or store any personal information, the Meta Quest platform may collect data such as device information, crash reports, or usage statistics. This collection is governed by Meta’s own Privacy Policy. We do not have access to or control over this information.

Data Deletion

Because Stick It Out does not collect or store personal data, there is no information for us to delete.
If in the future the game adds features that require storing user information, you will be able to request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us at the email listed below. Any such requests will be processed promptly.

Children’s Privacy

Stick It Out is designed for players of all ages. However, in accordance with platform requirements, the game is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.

Third Parties

Because Stick It Out does not connect to external services, no information is shared with third parties.
